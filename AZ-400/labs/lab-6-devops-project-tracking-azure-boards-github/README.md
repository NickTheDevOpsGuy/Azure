## 🔧 Prerequisites

• Azure DevOps organization with Azure Boards enabled
• GitHub repository with admin access
• Personal Access Token (PAT) for Azure DevOps (scope: Work Items, Code)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Connect GitHub to Azure Boards

Follow setup/github-boards-link.md to:

• Authorize GitHub repo in Azure Boards
• Configure PAT for access

2. Enable Work Item Linking

In commits/PRs, use this syntax:

Fixes AB#123
Implements AB#456

Azure Boards will automatically link those items to the commit or PR.

3. Enforce Work Item Mentions

Use a sample GitHub Action in workflows/sample-pr-workflow.yml to:
• Ensure all PRs mention an Azure Boards item (e.g., AB#123)
• Fail CI if missing

4. Visualize with Boards

Create queries and dashboards:
• Query: Open bugs per area path
• Chart: Work items by state
• View: Team capacity with effort by assignee
